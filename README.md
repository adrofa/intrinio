<Why this was created>

### `parser`
<This module is responsible for...>

- `parser.api`
<br/>Shared code provides easy access to Intrinio-API (US stocks), covers fundamental data with logical tets (to filter out mistakes) and restores some missing data. Most of the calculations are vectorized (with `pandas` / `numpy`), which makes feature-generation process rather fast.

- `parser.company`

### `processor`

- `fieldsCleaner`
<br/>The notebook presents an algorithm identifying groups of sim-cards, which belongs to one personality. The algorithm is based on geo data from the stations, which transmit mobile signal. By submitting this solution I was offered with a DS position in Megafon.

- `fundamentals`
<br/>Less then in 3 hours, I passed through ML project stages (exploratory data analysis, features preparation, model selection, and model tuning), trained a model, which outperforms naive algorithm, found important data insights.

- `prices`
<br/>Less then in 3 hours, I passed through ML project stages (exploratory data analysis, features preparation, model selection, and model tuning), trained a model, which outperforms naive algorithm, found important data insights.

### `technical`

- `config`
<br/>Less then in 3 hours, I passed through ML project stages (exploratory data analysis, features preparation, model selection, and model tuning), trained a model, which outperforms naive algorithm, found important data insights.

- `dumper`
