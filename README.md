## Data Science Profile - Artem Drofa <font color='red'>\[UNDER CONSTRUCTION\]</font>

My CV is available here: [ENG](https://github.com/adrofa/profile/blob/master/Artem_Drofa_CV_ENG.pdf), [RUS](https://github.com/adrofa/profile/blob/master/Artem_Drofa_CV_RUS.pdf).

### Pet Project
The project is dedicated to stocks selection for conservative buy-and-hold protfolio. Some code created in the framework of this project is shared below.

- **Code for Financial Data Processing** *(api: [intrinio.com](https://intrinio.com))* | jan-2020 | [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/adrofa/intrinio)
<br/>Shared code provides easy access to Intrinio-API (US stocks), covers fundamental data with logical tets (to filter out mistakes) and restores some missing data. Most of the calculations are vectorized (with `pandas` / `numpy`), which makes feature-generation process rather fast.

### Different Tasks

- **Multiple Sim-Cards Owners Detection** *(RUS)* | aug-2019 | [NBViewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/adrofa/portfolio/blob/master/jupyter_notebooks/multiple_sim_cards_owners_detection/multiple_sim_cards_owners_detection.ipynb)
<br/>The notebook presents an algorithm identifying groups of sim-cards, which belongs to one personality. The algorithm is based on geo data from the stations, which transmit mobile signal. By submitting this solution I was offered with a DS position in Megafon.

- **Task for Time** | 18-jul-2019 | [NBViewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/adrofa/portfolio/blob/master/jupyter_notebooks/task_for_time/task_for_time.ipynb)
<br/>Less then in 3 hours, I passed through ML project stages (exploratory data analysis, features preparation, model selection, and model tuning), trained a model, which outperforms naive algorithm, found important data insights.

### Competition Experience

- **Kaggle: ['Elo Merchant Category Recommendation'](https://www.kaggle.com/c/elo-merchant-category-recommendation)** | feb-2019
<br/>My final solution ranked top 9% at the private leaderboard and earned me a bronze medal. The solution can be viewed in the following Jupyter notebooks:
     > **Part I: Introduction, Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Cleaning** | [NBViewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/adrofa/profile/blob/master/jupyter_notebooks/elo/Elo_Report_1_EDA.ipynb)
     <br/>Competition description, visual data analysis, data cleaning (filling missing values etc.).
     <br/>**Part II: Feature Engineering** | [NBViewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/adrofa/profile/blob/master/jupyter_notebooks/elo/Elo_Report_2_FE.ipynb)
     <br/>Data modification (one-hot encoding, scaling etc.) and aggregation, elaboration of new features through a combination of existing ones, saving prepared train and test data sheets.
     <br/>**Part III: Model Training** | [NBViewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/adrofa/profile/blob/master/jupyter_notebooks/elo/Elo_Report_3_Training.ipynb)
     <br/>Models training and its parameters tuning, additional features engineering, models optimization and blending its predictions.
